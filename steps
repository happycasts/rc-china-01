1. :h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K 
   anything you want to add, add it to '.vim/dict/mywords', and then
     
     set dictionary+=~/.vim/dict/mywords
  
   so basiclly u can add whatever you want, but when you have sth like 'hello-world'
   you need:

     set isk+=-
   
   Ubuntu offer a English dict here: dictionary+=/usr/share/dict/words

   then use '*' to get the list

1. :h i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O
   show in css.
   check `:h new-omni-completion` to see which languages are supported, so rails is not on the list

1. :h i_CTRL-N
    
   OK, so ominifunc can not get me rails api, then what to do?

   check the default scope `:set complete`

   so now you know you can also get `tags`

        ctags -R . `rvm gemdir`      

   now I only get link_to, can I get sth like "<%= link_to ....%>", now enter
