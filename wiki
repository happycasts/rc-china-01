# i_ctrl_x_o

  i_ctrl_x_o  works nice with css
  i_ctrl_x_o works with snipmate
  snipmate working with zencoding
  use i_ctrl_x_o in .sql requires dbext.vim, which in turn itself is a must have:
  git clone https://github.com/vim-scripts/dbext.vim.git

  i_ctrl_x_o also works nicely for html( check `:h ft-html-omni`, but by default the rails views are `eruby` type, and even you set it to ft=html, still lots of trouble to use i_ctrl_x_o for it, bad, bad. But still for js file, it works.


#ctags rocks

    ctags -R . `rvm gemdir`

then use Ctrl-n, to auto-complete, `ptags xxx` or Ctrl-] to get the definition
so I have Ctags, I can use Ctrl-N to get all rails method, nice
but when I get link_to, can I get a code snipet as well?

# comment

both comment.vim and Nerdcomment.vim works horriably with erb file, 
my own solution is "delete + git throw", but don't worth sharing
